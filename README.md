## What is DisasterShield??

### Background Problem 
Increasingly hot temperatures and erratic weather are of concern to the public because they can affect their health and well-being. In emergency situations, such as natural disasters, accurate temperature and weather monitoring can help people take appropriate measures to avoid possible harm. However, the lack of accurate and easily accessible information about temperature and weather in certain areas can make it difficult for people to take preventive measures.

### Reason
The reason behind developing the Disaster Shield application is to provide real-time detection of natural disasters, specifically earthquakes, using machine learning technology. The application aims to leverage seismic data that is regularly updated from public sources and analyze it through machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model for detecting potential natural disasters.

### Solution
1. Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze regularly updated seismic data from public sources.
2. Train a predictive model to detect potential natural disasters, focusing on earthquakes.
3. Leverage cloud computing to store data and processing results.
4. Allow users to store emergency contact numbers and safe evacuation locations in the cloud.
5. Send notifications to users when a detected earthquake occurs in their area.
